                <p>Because there are reasonable reasons for keeping money offshore other than tax avoidance.
                <p>Multinational companies typically are not set up as a single entity. They typically set up different corporate entities for different countries/region or even multiple entities for a single country. The reason for this is to often to manage risk and compliance costs. Risk management prevents failures in one corporate entity from affecting other ones (ie if Latin America entity gets sued, it wouldn't effect the European operations.) Separate corporate entities also make it easier that the country may require certain local regulatory compliance is limited to that local entity (ie in some countries you need to mail a paper receipt even for online purchases.
                <p>So multinationals have many local entities that operate all through the world. Revenue generated via these local entities are officially earned by these local entities rather than the parent company. When the press talks about keeping money offshore, it usually means at these local entities. And when they send the money up to the parent company, this is often call repatriation.
                <p>There are many legitimate reasons other than tax avoidance why you wouldn't repatriate money.
                    <p><ul>
                        <li>
                            whenever you repatriate money from local entity, you need to do an fx conversion from foreign currency to USD. You may want to wait until better exchange rates before you convert (when you're talking about billions of dollars a couple basis points makes a huge difference).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            the company may use that money to reinvest in local operations. For example, Apple may use the money that it makes in China to expand operations in China. There's no point bringing the money back to the US, losing some in fx, then sending it back to China, losing more in fx (as well as additional taxes).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            the company may not know the future needs of capital investment, so it's better to keep them local than to repatriate. For example, Apple may want to expand operations in Brazil. Instead of sending money to the parent company and back down to Brazil, they may create a loan, sending money directly from China operations to Brazil
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            these local entities are paying local taxes where they are earned. When they send money back to the parent entity, they are taxed again for profit that they've already paid taxes on.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <p>So, to answer your question, it's not so clear when companies are keeping money offshore for tax avoidance or for legitimate reasons like using it for reinvestment in local operations. And there's no way to force a company to move their money from local entity to parent company (which triggers the tax event).
                <p>Lastly, it's a slippery slope if the US tries to tax profits at local entities which it has no jurisdiction over. Other countries have also talked about collecting taxes on worldwide profit. This would have the impact that companies that are headquartered in the US will have to pay taxes for profit made in the US to another country like Italy. This would unfairly hamper companies that operate in the US.

                <p>Aside from legitimate reasons for offshoring, a lot of the loopholes around offshoring for avoidance are being closed by the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act. The regulations compel Foreign Financial Institutions to disclose U.S. account holders, which can be either U.S. citizens or Non Financial Foreign Entities with substantial U.S. owners.
                <p>That legislation is finally going into effect this year and illustrates another reason why these 'loopholes' weren't closed before: it's extremely difficult to do. In order for legislation aimed at recovering US taxable assets stored offshore, to work it needs to:
                <p><ul>
                        <li>
                            Force foreign governments to be as committed to recovering money for the US as the IRS is;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Extend extraterritorial regulatory control over the financial institutions of countries likely to be used as tax shelters;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Build a carrot/stick structure that makes it worth a foreign government's while to accede to the first two items despite the absence of any kind of precedent in international law or direct regulatory/enforcement capability on the part of the IRS.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <p>FATCA tries to do all three of these things by threatening a 30 percent withholding penalty on any foreign institution that doesn't participate by reporting information on their U.S. account holders to either their own tax authority (which then reports to the IRS) or directly to the IRS itself. That may sound simple, but in reality it's immensely complex because of how many nations with differing banking systems, bodies of financial and privacy law, and relationships with the United States exist across the globe. Many countries have had to sign IGAs agreeing tomodify their own privacy laws to allow their financial institutions to comply with the domestic tax law of the United States.
                <p>And that's just the governmental side. The presumption of non compliance means that every bank, domestic or foreign, must classify and report on its entire customer base just to make sure it's not missing any US reportable accounts. That is an enormous burden for an institution and the goal of recovering tax doesn't directly benefit them in return. There are instances of foreign banks closing accounts held by U.S. citizens and refusing to open new ones so they won't fall under reporting requirements. There's also been an uptick in renunciation of U.S. citizenship by holders living abroad to avoid the regulation.
                <p>So while it may seem simple to just 'close the loophole,' it's actually a significant undertaking that involves big tradeoffs. How much cost are you willing to impose on banks and their customers in order to squeeze that extra tax money back to the IRS? Is the cost of implementation, maintenance and enforcement of the regulation going to add up to more than the tax money you recover? Is the unilateral extension of extraterritorial regulatory authority over other nations going to harm your image and relations abroad? Will the perception of overreach by US authorities cause some nations or institutions to actively facilitate avoidance in retaliation? Will it even work, considering you have to take a foreign tax authority or financial institution's word that the information they report is true and complete because reporting is technically voluntary and the IRS doesn't have statutory authority as a regulator to verify information on the accounts held by Foreign Financial Institutions not resident in the United States?

                <p>True, but Americans citizens living and working overseas have to pay taxes to both the local authorities AND the IRS - why should it be different for corporations?

                    True, but Americans citizens living and working overseas have to pay taxes to both the local authorities AND the IRS - why should it be different for corporations?

                    Increasingly we are seeing traction given to the theory that neanderthals went extinct because their chosen niche suffered. They ambushed hunted against the sapien's preference for plains hunting, so didn't compete for resources overmuch. Of course there are other theories, but it is important to remember that they did cohabit for tens of thousands of years and we cannot write that off because one side eventually perished.
                    <br>
                    My knowledge is too limited to say that one intelligent species cannot exist because the homo sapiens were all dead by 40,000 AD, but I hope that this illustrates the point I am making.

                    Actually, what we're seeing is that neanderthals seem to have been genetically assimilated into European, Mediterranean, and Asian populations of H. sapiens. The relatively low percentage of H. neandethalensis DNA in the genomes of these populations is probably due to comparative population sizes between H. sapiens and H. neanderthalensis rather than some sort of selective process.
